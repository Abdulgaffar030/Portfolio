I’m a Key Account Manager at Riseup Labs, acting as the main bridge between teams and clients. I started as a Data Analyst, then moved up to Senior Data Analyst, Associate, Senior Associate, and Project Supervisor in BPO. Later, I transitioned to KPO, taking on my current role as a Key Account Manager. With 5+ years in BPO and 3+ years in KPO, I’ve led teams, managed projects, and driven client success, earning multiple leadership awards along the way.

I’ve worked across industries like food, automotive insurance, and healthcare, which has helped me understand how different businesses operate. My core expertise is managing Engineers and Business Reporting teams, ensuring smooth operations and strong client relationships.

I also have experience as a Client Success Manager and a basic understanding of the Salesforce ecosystem. I can help businesses build Salesforce products and improve their processes. Lately, I’ve been diving into IT sales, marketing strategies, and Account-Based Marketing (ABM).

With a background in Computer Science, I’ve always been passionate about technology. My big goal for 2025 is to master GTM Engineering, and I’m actively exploring AI tools to build a solid foundation.

Let’s connect and explore opportunities!
